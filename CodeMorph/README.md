# CodeMorph

CodeMorph is a VS Code extension that converts code between languages automatically when you rename a file  
(e.g. renaming `Solution.java` → `Solution.py` converts the code instantly using AI).

---

## 🚧 Project Status

CodeMorph is currently in **early testing (pre-release)**.

The core conversion workflow is functional, but we are actively testing and improving:

- conversion accuracy
- edge cases
- UX clarity
- performance

Bugs, imperfect output, and rough edges are expected at this stage — and helpful 🙂

## ✨ Core Idea

Instead of copy‑pasting code or running commands, CodeMorph treats **file renaming as intent**.

You rename a file → CodeMorph understands you want a language change → it converts the code for you.

Simple, fast, and native to your workflow.

## ✅ Supported Conversions (v1)

- Java ↔ Python  

(More languages planned in future versions.)
